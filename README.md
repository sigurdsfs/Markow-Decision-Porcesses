# Markow-Decision-Processes

### Project: 
1) Solving Markow Decision Processes (MDP) model
   - Using the recurrences relating the value Vπ(s) and Q-value Qπ(s, a), which represents the expected
     utility from starting at the corresponding nodes in the MDP graph.
   - Given these mathematical recurrences, we produced algorithms: policy evaluation computes the value of
a policy, and value iteration computes the optimal policy.

2) Solving MDPs with unknown transistion function T(s,a,s') & reward functions r(s,a,s').
   - Monte Carlo Method.
   - Bootstrapping.
